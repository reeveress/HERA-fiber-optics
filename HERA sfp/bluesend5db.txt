Sending from blue channel tx into 10km Long Distance Network Simulation Test Box(LDNSTB) left channel, output routed from right channel of LDNSTB and into optical attenuator and back into RX of the red  channel on SNAP. This is only a one way connection since the Optical AttenuatorI'm using doesn't have a duplex LC connector. The blue tranceiver is on the right and red on the left just like in the previous red channel send setup.
